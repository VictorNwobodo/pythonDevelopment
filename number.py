#printing a number in python is easy.

print(45)

#Using a variable to print a number.

number = 45
print(number) #this method can still go with mathemacial operations like adding numbers together.

num1 = 100
num2 = 300
genNum = num1 + num2
print(genNum, "Is the value gotten!")
# Here I created a variable that holds and adds up to different variable with just a single root variable called the 'genNum"
