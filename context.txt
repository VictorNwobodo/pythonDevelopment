1. PRINT FUNCTION IN PYTHON:

The print function helps you to display a content on the browser(client side) of terminal(server side).

2. VARIABLE FUNCTION:

A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing. Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc.

In variable there is what we call "concatenation" which helps you with the combination of "string" and "integer". eg: 

age = 20
print("I am " +age, )

Note that you can only use the "," to concatenate an integer but in the case of string we can use both "," and "+" to concatenate.

STRING:

Strings are just plain written text. eg:

"Hello Welcome to my python repo"print.py

The "\n" adds a break to our strings integer which is usually used when you want the value to start from a new line.
